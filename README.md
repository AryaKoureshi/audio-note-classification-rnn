# audio-note-classification-rnn
Automated classification of musical notes from short WAV recordings Using time‐ and frequency‐domain feature extraction (raw waveform, FFT, wavelet, MFCC) and three RNN architectures (SimpleRNN, LSTM, GRU), this project trains and evaluates models to recognize musical notes.
